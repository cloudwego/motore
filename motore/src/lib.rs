//! # Overview
//!
//! Motore is a library of the basic abstractions of middlewares for building
//! robust networking clients and servers.
//!
//! Motore is greatly inspired by the [`tower`] crate, and we have used / modified
//! some of `Tower`'s code and documentation. We really appreciate the work that
//! the `Tower` team have done.
//!
//! `Tower` is licensed under the MIT license, and a copy can be found under
//! the [`licenses/tower`](https://github.com/cloudwego/motore/tree/main/licenses/tower) directory.
//!
//! Motore provides a simple core abstraction, the [`Service`] trait, which
//! represents an asynchronous function taking a request and returning either a
//! response or an error. This abstraction can be used to model both clients and
//! servers.
//!
//! Generic components, like `timeouts`, `rate limiting`, and `load balancing`,
//! can be modeled as [`Service`]s that wrap some inner service and apply
//! additional behavior before or after the inner service is called. This allows
//! implementing these components in a protocol-agnostic, composable way. Typically,
//! such services are referred to as _middleware_.
//!
//! An additional abstraction, the [`Layer`] trait, is used to compose
//! middleware with [`Service`]s. If a [`Service`] can be thought of as an
//! asynchronous function from a request type to a response type, a [`Layer`] is
//! a function taking a [`Service`] of one type and returning a [`Service`] of a
//! different type. The [`ServiceBuilder`] type is used to add middleware to a
//! service by composing it with multiple [`Layer`]s.
